# ComplexMixtures.jl - Example

## Crowded solution of glycerol in water

This example illustrates the use of ComplexMixtures.jl to study the solution structure of a crowded (1:1 molar fraction) solution of glycerol in water. Here, we compute the distribution function and atomic contributions associated to the inter-species interactions (water-glycerol) and auto-correlation functions (water-water and glycerol-glycerol). This example aims to illustrate how to obtain a detailed molecular picture of the solvation structures in a mixture of molecules of irregular (non-spherical) shapes, using ComplexMixtures.jl.
