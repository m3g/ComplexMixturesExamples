# Minimum-Distance Distribuion function
## Here we compute the minimum-distance distribution function, the Kirkwood-Buff integral, and the atomic contributions of the solvent to the density.

This example illustrates the regular usage of `ComplexMixtures`, to compute the minimum distance distribution function, KB-integrals and group contributions. 

## How to run this example:
