# ComplexMixtures.jl Example

## Polyacrylamide in DMF

In this example we illustrate how the solvation structure of a polymer can be studied with ComplexMixtures.jl. The system is a 4-mer segment of polyacrylamide (PAE - capped with methyl groups), solvated with dimethylformamide (DMF). The system is interesting because of the different functional groups and polarities involved in the interactions of DMF with PAE. A snapshot of the system is shown below.
